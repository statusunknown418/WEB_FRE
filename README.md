![My IDE with the font](https://github.com/AlvaroAquijeDiaz/WEB_FRE/blob/main/IMG/editor.png)
**Updated** : Added new folders and files 
- Also added a ***.zshrc*** file, so you can have a nice shell like mine **[ actually ]** may work better with
Horizon Theme in VSCODE, looks great.

# Starting on WEB DEVELOPMENT
## HTML5
---
#### **A : Tags**

1. Hr and br serve as the same but hr inserts a line breaker

#### **B : Links**

1. < link > is used to referentiate Stylesheets
2. < a > tag is used for real hyperlinks
3. Finished with HTML, yaii!

## CSS
---
**NORMALIZE.CSS is useful**
---
#### **A: Useful info:**

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left,
and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific
padding instructions ==>

*padding*: 40px 20px 20px 40px

#### **B: Units:**
    
The most used units are relative [em, rem] and absolute [inch, mm]
1. Em is based on the size of an element's FONT. ---> **We can define *em* giving the parent element a certain value in *px***
2. Rem is based on the root element.

#### **C: VARIABLES:** 

They can simplify the usage of ***MEDIA QUERIES***, so understanding
them is **VERY** *IMPORTANT*.

#### **D: Margins, paddings, border:**

## Visual Design

### CORE FUNDAMENTALS
- **Selectors**

    + Universal : * {props: value} 
        Selects every element on the document
    + Type : < element-name >{props: value} =>
    **h1 {color: red}** 
    
    + Class : <.elementId>{props: value} => **.blueBox{background-color: blue}**
    + ID : < #elemtntID > {props: value} 

#### **A: Element alligment with CSS**

We use the formatting parameters similar as in, for example, MS Word.

- **NOTE** : 
    * ***box shadow*** : < offset-x >, < offset-y >, < blur-radius >, < spread-radius >, < color >; 

        Creates a shadow arround an element (useful in **divs**).

    * ***font-weight*** : Goes from **1000** to **0**

#### **B: TEXT PROPERTIES**
| **Value** | **RESULT** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **lowercase** | "transform me" |
| **uppercase** | "TRANSFORM ME" |
| **cap√≠talize** | "Transform Me" |
| **inherit** | *Use the **text-transform** value from parent element* |

#### **C: POSITIONS**
+ When the position of an element is set to ***relative***, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to **its current position** in the normal flow of the page.

- Relative
- Absolute
- **Sticky**
